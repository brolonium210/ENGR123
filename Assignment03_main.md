![Question 1](images/A3Q1.png)

### a)
$$R = \{(a,a),(b,b),(a,b),(b,a)\}$$
- It is reflexive as (a,a) is true (a votes for the same party as themselves)
- It is Symmetric as if a voted for party x and b voted for party x they are related both ways
- Not Asymmetric as they don't interact in this way
- It is Transitive as if (a,b) then (a,c)


### b)
$$ R = \{(a,b),(b,a)\} $$
- It is not reflexive as the condition of being different in the top left prevent this 
- It is Symmetric
- It is not Antisymmetric
- It couldnt be transitive as if (a is different to b) and (b is different to c) there is a possibility of a and c being the same

![Question 2](images/A3Q2.png)

- there exists some number such that 3a = x+y
- x and y will be reflexive as they are some number
- x and y arent necessarily symmetrical they dont need to equal each other

![Question 4](images/A3Q4.png)

### a)
- being able to to speak another language does not prevent someone from playing a musical instrument so these are not partitions
- However being unable to do either is a valid partition as it will not share any of the other two conditions 
### b)
- all 3 are clear conditions that will produce 3 clear partitions of the larger set

### c)
- none of these are valid partitions because of the double degree options
- they could all share elements and are not partitions of the set
